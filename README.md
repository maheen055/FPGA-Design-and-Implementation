# Design-and-Implementation
Using the Altera MAX10 FPGA chip and Intel Quartus-Prime, I implemented and tested various digital circuits in both schematic and VHDL representations. I verified these digital circuit representations through functional simulations and validated the FPGA designs on the LogicalStep FPGA Development Board.
